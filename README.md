# AdventOfCode2016
Advent of Code puzzles, each day done in a different language.

For days 1-8, I picked the language myself.  Starting with day 9, I used the code in language_selection.lisp to pick the languages for me from a list of languages I've heard of and that seemed general enough to be viable.  If I start working on one and decide it's not viable (I'm looking at you, assembly), I reserve the right to randomly select a different language from the list to replace it.

Here are the languages by day:  
Day  1 - Haskell  
Day  2 - JavaScript  
Day  3 - C  
Day  4 - Lisp  
Day  5 - Rust  
Day  6 - PHP  
Day  7 - Python  
Day  8 - Ruby  
Day  9 - Shell  
Day 10 - Lua  
Day 11 - Erlang  
Day 12 - Java  
Day 13 - Prolog  
Day 14 - Go  
Day 15 - OCaml  
Day 16 - Scala  
Day 17 - C++  
Day 18 - R  
Day 19 - Swift  
Day 20 - Assembly  
Day 21 - Ada  
Day 22 - Pascal  
Day 23 - Clojure  
Day 24 - Fortran  
Day 25 - Cobol
