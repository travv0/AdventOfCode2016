# Advent of Code 2016
Advent of Code puzzles, each day done in a different language.

For days 1-8, I picked the language myself.  Starting with day 9, I used the code in [language_selection.lisp](https://github.com/tssund93/AdventOfCode2016/blob/master/language_selection.lisp) to randomly pick the languages for me from a list of languages I've heard of and that seemed general enough to be viable.  If I start working on one and decide it's not viable (I'm looking at you, assembly), I reserve the right to randomly select a different language from the list to replace it.  I don't expect to be done with this by Christmas.

Here are the languages by day:
- [X] Day  1 - Haskell  
- [X] Day  2 - JavaScript  
- [X] Day  3 - C
